# Per Scholas SBA 307
## About This Project
I attempted to roughly copy YouTube's website layout 

## Getting Started
Open index.html in the browser to start

## SBA Requirements
- Inline styling used for first card in index.html line 226
- Internal styling sheet used for video.html
- External styling used for index.html

## Reflection
- Would have made a wireframe first and thought about more useful, meaningful and intentful features
- A lot of repetition. Would separate into separate files to keep it DRY
- Would add more margins and padding, fix icon sizes in nav bar, add more to video.html
- It helped keep my code organized and separated with comments

### Built with
[![Bootstrap 5.2.3][Bootstrap.com]][Bootstrap-url]
